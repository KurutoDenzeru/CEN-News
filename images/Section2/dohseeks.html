				<p>A senior citizen receives a COVID-19 jab at Pinyahan Elementary School in 
				Quezon city during the continuation of inoculation of Sinovac vaccine on April 14, 2021.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<p>MANILA, Philippines &mdash; The Department of Health has filed for Food and Drug Administration clearance of a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose for the elderly and immunocompromised, an official said Tuesday.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The DOH has already submitted an application to the FDA for the amendment of emergency use authorization 
				[of COVID-19 vaccines to allow] fourth doses,&rdquo; Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said partly
				 in Filipino during a briefing.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;So we will wait for the decision of FDA on this and after that, we will discuss for the 
				possible implementation,&rdquo; she added.</p>

			<p>The government&rsquo;s vaccine expert panel earlier recommended giving a second COVID-19 booster shot to 
				senior citizens and immunocompromised individuals. The elderly and people with comorbidities are at higher
				 risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p>

			<p>Currently, the EUA of COVID-19 jabs in the country allows only the administration of primary shots and booster doses.</p>

			<p>Over 65.2 million Filipinos have completed vaccination against COVID-19. Meanwhile, more than 
				11.6 million people have received boosters.</p>
