			<p>A 31-YEAR-OLD cyclist was hurt after an unidentified man onboard a sport utility vehicle (SUV) shot him for no reason in Barangay Cogon Ramos, Cebu City on Wednesday night, March 16, 2022.</p>

			<p>John Rey Jaca, 31, of A. Lopez St., Barangay Labangon, Cebu City was riding his bicycle along Gen. 
			Maxilom when the gunman disembarked from his SUV and shot Jaca multiple times. Jaca, who sustained gunshot wounds 
			in his stomach and leg, was immediately brought to a nearby hospital.</p>

			<p>The police believed that the suspect was already waiting for the victim.</p>

			<p>Lt. Col. Maria Theresa Macatangay, information officer of the Cebu City Police Office, 
				said they are now looking for any CCTV camera in the area that would help them identify the suspect.</p>

			<p>Based on the background check conducted by the Abellana Police Station, 
				Jaca had a pending case in court after being arrested in 2016 for illegal drugs.</p>

			<p>Macatangay said the police would focus their investigation on the drug angle as the victim had been involved in 
				illegal drug activity.</p>
