			<hr>
			<p>OIL firms announced a price rollback—the first time since the start of the year—effective 
			Tuesday morning after 11 consecutive weeks of oil price increases.</p>

			<p>They announced on Monday that gasoline prices will go down by P5.45 per liter, diesel by P11.45 per liter, 
			and kerosene by P8.55 per liter. The price adjustment takes effect at 6 a.m., March 22, for Seaoil, 
			PTT Philippines, Total Philippines, Caltex Philippines, Pilipinas Shell, Petron Corp., and Phoenix Petroleum. For Cleanfuel, 
			the price rollback will be implemented at 8:01 a.m.</p>

			<p>Eastern Petroleum, meanwhile, will implement a higher price rollback for gasoline, P5.50 per liter, and for diesel, P11.50 per liter.</p>

			<p>This is the first oil price rollback for the year.</p>

			<p>Last week, diesel price shot up by P13.15 per liter, gasoline by P7.10 per liter and kerosene by P10.50 per liter. 
			These resulted to the year-to-date adjustments to stand at a net increase of P20.35/liter for gasoline, 
			P30.65/liter for diesel and P24.90/liter for kerosene.</p>

			<p>Local pump prices are mostly determined by the price of crude oil, peso-dollar exchange rate, among others.</p>

			<p>The series of oil price increases was mainly brought about by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
			Russia is among the world’s biggest oil producers. Even if Russia is not a supplier of oil and gas to the Philippines, 
			which is heavily dependent on imported oil, the global supply disruptions caused oil prices to escalate.</p>

			<p>The country&rsquo;s oil firms adjust their prices every Tuesday to reflect movements in the world oil market.</p>

			<p>Department of Energy (DOE) Undersecretary Gerardo Erquiza said crude oil prices went down for a few days during last week&rsquo;s trading. This, he said, could be attributed to the re-emergence of Covid in China and the possible meeting between the leaders of Russia and Ukraine.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;The pandemic worsened in China, resulting to lockdowns. The economy slowed down that&rsquo;s why demand was affected. This helped. Also, last week, the ties between Russia and Ukraine seemed improving,&rdquo; he said.</p>

			<p>The DOE, he said, continuous to monitor local oil prices. He could not say if the price rollback this week would continue in the weeks to come. &ldquo;All we can do is to monitor. I believe what goes up must come down, but the question is when,&rdquo; said Erquiza.</p>

			<p>The DOE has assured the public on the sufficiency of the country&rsquo;s oil supply amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

			<p>&ldquo;We are not lacking in supply given that we source our crude oil requirements primarily from the Middle East, and finished products from Asia-Pacific. However, the impact of the Ukraine crisis on international oil markets does have a direct effect on our prices. This is why we continue to appeal to everyone to observe energy efficiency and conservation measures during this critical period,&rdquo; Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi earlier said.</p>
