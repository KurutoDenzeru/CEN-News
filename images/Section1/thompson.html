			<p>&quot;We have just been informed that one of our artists, Mr. Kit Thompson, was allegedly involved in an incident that transpired last night in Tagaytay City, Cavite. As we have yet to receive a formal report regarding the alleged incident, we could not give a response nor comment on the matter.</p>

			<p>However, we request the public to be mindful of casting judgment based on unfounded reports being circulated online.&quot;</p>

			<p>Kit Thompson became known in showbiz after joining Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 4 in 2012. He then landed several roles in showbiz in the same year.</p>
